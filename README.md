## Traffic Sign Recognition with YOLOv8

This project uses a YOLOv8 model 'yolov8s.pt' for detecting traffic signs. The model was trained on a dataset of traffic signs for **20 epochs** and utilizes the best-performing weights for inference.

### How to Run Inference

To run inference on an image, video, or directory of files, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Traffic-Sign-Recognition.git
cd Traffic-Sign-Recognition
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the inference script:

```bash
python inference.py /path/to/images_or_videos
```
- **source**: Path to the input file(s) (image, video, or directory with them).
Results will be saved in the `results` folder, where the modelâ€™s predictions will be stored. The images will include detected labels and bounding boxes.
